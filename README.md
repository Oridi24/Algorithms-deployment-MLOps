# Algorithms-deployment-MLOps
This repository demonstrates the deployment of a machine learning algorithm following MLOps best practices. It includes the full pipeline from model training to real-time inference through an API. The goal is to make the model easily accessible, scalable, and maintainable in a production environment.
